review
"I feel like I have a hangover. All day! Headaches, tired, weak, just feel awful!"
"Overall better than other BP meds, but now I'm starting to develop stomach and GI tract issues. My BP is okay on benicar."
Puke that's my life now. Can't we sue drug company or doctor?????
Legs hurt at nite nausea fast heart rate in the 100's at rest difficulty sleeping anxious
"Been ill for 2 years! Severe body pain, BP plummets suddenly, constipation, headache severe insomnia, major fatigue, weakness is miserable. Dr. wants me to continue taking it!!!"

Feeling more anxious and lightheaded.
"This drug did not lower my BP much yet caused numerous side effects. When my doctor told me it is ok to take an afternoon nap if you are tired and after time, the fatigue will go away. Not true. I could not walk without getting dizzy and running out of breath. That is not a normal quality of life."
"Muscle aches all over body, fatigue, limbs feel heavy, physical stamina terribly reduced."
"Lowered pressure but feel tired, muscle aches, insomnia, jittery, bloated, dizzy, unmotivated. If the side effects get worse I’m quitting."
"Hair loss, stomach problems similar to celiac disease, fatigue. Physician did not feel medication was problem.Never had these symptoms prior to Benicar. I switched doctors and stopped taking this poison. Now taking losartan, no stomach problems...."
"Joint pain/joint stiffness, feeling tired & weak"
I cant explain how much grief this drug has caused me. I have pkd. 44yr old slight discomfort no have kidney pain. Dr says lets start benicar to lower bp 140/90. 20mg a day of benicar and 20days later it worked. 30days later unbelievable kidney pain. Herromaged kidney cyst never had this before. Dr tells its not the medication? Tried to stop the med got way worse lowered dosage by half trying to weaning off wish i had never used this garbage.
"Numb left arm and neck, no energy weak all over, legs not functioning, cramps, pins and needles, no sleep, can hardly hold my head up, totally debilitating symptoms.. Lost weight and already small framed and light build.	"
After an hour left side pain ringing in ears weak light headed feel like hell doctors unwilling to change
"Tired all the time, was 230lb when started, now 266lb even though I do exercise. Almost same time (coincidence?) I started drug I came down with chronic sinusitis with constant green slime running out my nose and down back of throat, pending surgery for this. But BP fell from 180/150 to normal..."
